He started out his career as a web developer back in 2000, working his way up to Software Engineering Manager for the BBC, before joining DAZN to head up their brand-new development centre.</p> <p>Talk 1 - Message Driven Micro-Architectures<br/>Many of us have used messages and queueing systems to enhance performance in our applications. They are indeed powerful and flexible! From his experiences at Sky and unique approach being addressed at DAZN, Rich will show us how by leveraging 'message-driven' further in a decoupled architecture using micro-components can enable us to build resilient and fault tolerant systems quickly at scale.</p> <p>Bio: Bio: Rich McIntyre is a no-nonsense straight-talking technology enthusiast who has a wealth of experience in developing and designing systems being accessed by millions of people. He has been active in open-source communities in both Leeds and Japan. He is just moving on from Sky to join DAZN as Software Engineering Manager alongside Rob.</p> <p>Talk 2 - What has RxJS ever done for us? \"Practical application and testing of RxJS data streams.\"<br/>Alex will make a brief overview of what is an RxJS stream. He will take us through a few practical problems solved with RxJS in DAZN and how RxJS helped DAZN write clean, declarative and testable code.</p> <p>Bio: Alex is a Software Engineer in DAZN, a Storyteller, a coffee drinker and a dog father... Sometimes concurrently and in no particular order.</p> "

  description: "<p>After our extended summer break we're back at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 23rd October for a night of Devops chatter:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : Azure DevOps<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Accelerating Delivery Velocity With Kubernetes<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>Our first talk is from Simon Thurman who is a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, he'll be showcasing Microsoft's latest toolchain, covering the components of the system such as pipelines, test plans, artifact repos, boards and more. Simon will demonstrate the steps involved and interactions as code moves from commit to production in Azure Devops.</p> <p>Our headline speaker is Simon Westcott a hands-on architect with 10+ yrs experience of building high traffic websites. In late 2016 Simon moved into the world of platform engineering to help re-imagine Sky Betting &amp; Gaming's delivery approach and drive operational efficiency. Delivery agility is key to Simon and his Team's success. As their engineering team grows, they have an increasing number of greenfield products to comission, as well as monolithic applications to decompose into microservices. To manage this they need a platform that can keep pace, both in the cloud and on-premise. Simon will explore with you why they choose Kubernetes, how they're adapting both on AWS and on-premise and the challenges they faced.</p> <p>As an extra treat we'll also be giving away 2 tickets for the upcoming DevOpsDays Edinburgh conference on the 1st and 2nd of November.</p> <p>Once again we say a massive \"Thank You\" to Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for sponsoring the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
