ACCU York is a local group of the [ACCU][accu-site], meeting most months to discuss a wide range of topics relating to software development.

What is ACCU? No longer an acronym, ACCU stands for professionalism in programming. We promote self-improvement for software practitioners. C++, Java, Agile, functional: whatever you're interested in, our members are too.

See ACCU York on [Meetup][accu-york-meetup] and [Mastodon][accu-york-mastodon] for more information on when we meet.
